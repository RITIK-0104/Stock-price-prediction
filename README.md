# Stock-price-prediction

It’s project about prediction of stock prices, in which we have trained the previous prices data set of any company using Yahoo Finance API and predict the future trends by plotting graphs.
I utilized the Matplotlib library to create insightful visualizations of historical stock price data,
helping to identify patterns and trends. To evaluate the model’s accuracy, I implemented appropriate evaluation metrics and
analyzed the predictions against the actual stock prices.
